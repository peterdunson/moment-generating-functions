# Moment Generating Function Visualizer

A minimal interactive tool to understand moment generating functions (MGFs)
as geometric objects.

## What this shows
- MGFs as functions of t
- Why derivatives at t = 0 give moments
- How different distributions reshape the MGF
- Where MGFs fail to exist

## How to run
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
